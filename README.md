## **Main Features Explained** <a name="features"></a>

### File Management System <a name="fms"></a>
The main window of the File Manager provides an easy way to navigate through any files and directories on the system. The **left panel** shows the contents of the current directory, and highlights the selected content with green color. The **center panel** is for search window and shows the contents of the selected directory (if not a file). The right panel shows stats of the selected file/directory along with CPU and RAM usage. Here is the preview of the main window:
<div><center>File Manager Main window</center></div>

Navigate using the arrow keys!
Right key opens to the selected directory and left key moves back to the previous directory.

The bottom row bar displays all the possible commands to **copy, move, delete and create new** files and folders, **search** through directories, and start the **Terminal!**

### Terminal <a name="terminal"></a>
The built-in terminal can be toggled by pressing `Shift+TAB`
It can run all Linux commands and system calls. It can also execute user defined programs. However, it does not support interactive programs yet. 

Here's a preview of how it looks:
<div><center>Terminal Preview</center></div>

The input can be given at the bottom most line and the output will be presented in the **Terminal Output** panel. The terminal panel becomes *orange* if your program is still executing. The terminal also supports scrolling if the output is more than the screen size.

---
### Editor <a name="editor"></a>
To edit files on the go, navigate to the file and pressing ```e``` would open the file in the built-in editor. The editor is line-by-line scrollable and we have made sure to handle several corner cases that may arise. 

The current editor is customized for python files, highlighting keywords, adding indentation spaces and auto-completing brackets and strings.

The editor currently also supports cut/copy/paste and find-replace utilities. Following are the screenshots for the same.

### Quick Search <a name="search"></a>

To enable the search bar, enter `ctrl + a`. It initiates a trie creation from the current folder in a different process. As soon as the trie is created, it is returned to the main process (the File Manager) to initiate the search. Larger the folder size, larger the size of the trie and more RAM used for storing. However, once created, the trie is stored for further use in **Pickle File** format which uses very less space and saves trie creation time!
Here is a preview of search!

The top bar shows the trie creation process!

Here is how searching looks:
<div><center>Searching through files/folders</center></div>

![](images/on_search.png)

It can search for thousands of files giving results instantly. Scroll and navigate through the found items. The **search_files** folder stores the pickle files created after intiating search. 
<div><center>Scrolling through results</center></div>

![](images/search_all_res0.png)


When searching, top right corner shows the number of search results.
Scrolling through the search results and then pressing enter will take you to the paths on which the actual file/folder is present.
<div><center>After selecting result, scrolling through the locations where result appear</center></div>

After pressing enter on one of the paths, you will be redirected to that location.
